Requires DirectX11 (Feb 2010).  Made in Visual Studio 2010 in Windows 7.
If you can't get it to work on your machine, please let me know.

There's not much to it: right click to attract the points, left click to repel them.
Spacebar resets the simulation.  That's it!

This is my first submission so if I'm doing something n00bish please tell me.
